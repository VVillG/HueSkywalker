>This is my [website](https://www.gerouldstudios.com) for my 2017 summer research portfolio as well as my final project for DIGIT 400. >This site was developed with the intention to showcase my work and give myself a presence as a digital creator. Using bootstrap and python, we designed our sites from the ground up.
